# MyRecorder
Example project using OpenTK.OpenAL for recording audio using the default recording device in C# .netcore (Cross-platform)

- Linux x64 (Tested using Zorin OS)
- Windows 10 x64 (Tested Windows 10 Pro)
  Require the openal32.dll (https://openal.org/downloads/). 
  > Historically Windows had that dll by default. It's OS's library rather than OpenTK's (https://github.com/opentk/opentk/issues/1169)
- Mac OS (not tested)
